Contributions
------------------

We follow typical `GitHub flow
<https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html>`_.

1. `Fork this repository <https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/>`_ into your personal space. 
2. Start a new topical branch for any contribution. Name it sensibly,
   e.g. ``translation-to-french``.
3. Test your branch on a local site. If everything works as expected,
   please sign your commits to indicate its quality.
4. Create logically separate commits for logically separate things.
5. Please add directives in your commit log
   message if your pull request closes an open issue, e.g. ``(closes #123)``.
6. Issue a `pull request <https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/>`_. 
   If the branch is not quite ready yet, please indicate ``WIP`` (=work in progress) in the pull request title.
